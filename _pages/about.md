I am currently a Ph.D student at Graduate School of Data Science in Seoul National University, South Korea. I am currently a member of AIoT lab led by professor Hyungsin Kim. 
My primary research interest lies in **Sleep AI, Lightweight AI models and optimization for on-device inference** - for example, Quantization, Knowledge distillation for sleep related applications or process optimization for heteregeneous processors (CPU-NPU or CPU-GPU-NPU etc.).
Recently, I am particularly interested in building **a Foundation Model for sleep analysis / diagnosis / treatment to democratize polysomnography (PSG)**, which necessitates high cost and long time for patients.
Before I enter the graduate school I worked as an actuary in Milliman for seven years and experienced diverse topics ranging actuarial science, corporate IT systems and finance.
