I am currently a Ph.D student at Graduate School of Data Science in Seoul National University, South Korea. I entered the school as a master student in 2020, finished my degree in 2022 and proceeded to Ph.D in 2022. I am currently a member of AIoT lab led by professor Hyungsin Kim. 
My primary research interest lies in **Sleep AI, Lightweight AI models and optimization for on-device inference** - for example, Quantization, Knowledge distillation for sleep related applications or process optimization for heteregeneous processors (CPU-NPU or CPU-GPU-NPU etc.)
Before I enter the graduate school I worked as an actuary in Milliman for seven years and experienced diverse topics ranging actuarial science, corporate IT systems and finance.
